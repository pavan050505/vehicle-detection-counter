**Vehicle Detection and Category-Wise Counting using OpenCV**

This project focuses on detecting and categorizing vehicles in real-time from video streams or camera feeds using OpenCV and Python. The system identifies vehicles such as cars, bikes, trucks, and buses, and keeps a live count of each category. It's designed for smart traffic management systems and can be integrated with traffic monitoring tools for better insights and control.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using Haar Cascades / pre-trained object detection models  
- Category-wise vehicle classification (Car, Bike, Bus, Truck)  
- Frame-by-frame object tracking for accurate counting  
- Dynamic region of interest (ROI) for optimized detection zones  
- Simple UI to visualize live counts and bounding boxes  
- Video file or webcam input support
